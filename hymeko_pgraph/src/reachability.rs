//! Reachability rules over the P-graph producibility closure.
//!
//! The audit-side analogue lives at
//! `signedkan_wip/src/baselines/reachability.py`; the unifying argument is in
//! `docs/plans/2026-06-14-reachability-rules-audit-pgraph/argument.md`. A
//! *reachability rule* decides which units seed the producibility closure
//! [`crate::msg::close_producible`] — the same closure the ABB reachability
//! bound and SSG feasibility already evaluate. The three rules form a monotone
//! lattice `Strict ⊆ TransductiveTopology ⊆ TransductiveFull`:
//!
//! - **Strict** — only *confirmed* units seed the closure (the canonical PNS
//!   behaviour, `R₀`): candidates are unreachable.
//! - **TransductiveTopology** — candidate units' *connectivity* seeds the
//!   closure (their outputs become producible), but their costs are withheld —
//!   an optimistic, still-admissible bound for ABB.
//! - **TransductiveFull** — candidate units are fully available, costs included.
//!
//! Topology and Full produce the *same* producibility closure (both admit
//! candidate outputs); they diverge only at the cost/admissibility layer, via
//! [`ReachabilityRule::counts_candidate_cost`]. That split mirrors the audit's
//! topology-vs-full distinction (reachable connection vs reachable label).
